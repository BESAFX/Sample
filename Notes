- Start Metro:
npx react-native start

- Run Android:
npx react-native run-android

- Run Emulator:
emulator -avd [DEVICE_NAME]

- Generating keystore file:
cd android/app && keytool -genkey -v -keystore sample.keystore -alias sample -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

- Building APK
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease

- Installing APK file to Emulator:
cd android/app/build/outputs/apk/release &&  adb install -r app-release.apk

- In case you want to run APP on emulator without Metro Server:
Step 1: Create a directory in android/app/src/main/assets
      >> mkdir android/app/src/main/assets
Step 2: Rename index.android.js (in root directory) to index.js (Maybe there is an index.js file in which case you do not need to rename it) then run the following command:
      >> react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res
Step 3: Build your APK: react-native run-android

- In case you want to clean and build android folder again:
npm i react-native-eject
npm i @react-native-community/cli
react-native eject
